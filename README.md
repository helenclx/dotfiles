# Helen Chong's Dot Files

Configuration files for my Linux home directory, managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

These files are primarily intended for [Fedora Linux](https://www.fedoraproject.org/), with [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as the desktop environment.

## Instructions

1. Install [yadm](https://yadm.io/).
1. Clone this repository with yadm.
1. Install my bootstrap program for yadm when prompted.

## Additional Setup

In addition to these dot files, I have a custom setup for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), my main editor. See [my LazyVim repository](https://git.helenchong.dev/helenchong/LazyVim) for more information.
