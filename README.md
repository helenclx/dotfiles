# Helen Chong's Dot Files

Dot files for my Linux home, managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

These files are primarily intended for Fedora Linux with KDE Plasma desktop environment.

## Instructions

1. Install yadm.
2. Clone this repository with yadm.
3. Run the `setup-home.sh` script.

## Additional Setup

In addition to these dot files, I have a custom setup for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), my main editor. See [my LazyVim repository](https://git.helenchong.dev/helenchong/LazyVim) for more information.
