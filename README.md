# Helen Chong's Dot Files

Configuration files for my Linux home directory, managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

These files are primarily intended for [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as the desktop environment. My personal computer's Linux distribution is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), but since I also use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) on my remote servers, and have used [Fedora Linux](https://www.fedoraproject.org/), the setup of this repository supports these distros.

## Instructions for Using This Repository

1. Open `/etc/locale.gen`, and make sure these locales are not commented out:
    ```
    en_GB.UTF8 UTF8
    en_SG.UTF8 UTF8
    ms_MY.UTF8 UTF8
    ```
    - If the file `/etc/locale.gen` has been edited, save the file, then generate the locale by running the `locale-gen` command.
1. Install [yadm](https://yadm.io/).
1. Clone this repository with yadm.
1. Install my bootstrap program for yadm when prompted.
1. Reboot the system to apply changes to the system locale.

## List of Software that Uses These Configuration Files

Software marked with * will be installed by the bootstrap script of this yadm repository, otherwise the system wilil throw error or warning messages due to the absence of these software.

- [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects)
- [Fcitx 5](https://fcitx-im.org/)
    - A package for configurating Fcitx 5, such as `kcm-fcitx5`, `kde-config-fcitx5` or `fcitx5-configtool`
    - [fcitx5-chinese-add-ons](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5-chinese-addons)
	- A Chinese font such as `noto-fonts-cjk` is required to display Chinese characters
    - It is strongly recommended to install the `fcitx5-qt` and `fcitx5-gtk` packages to ensure Fcitx 5 works consistently across apps
